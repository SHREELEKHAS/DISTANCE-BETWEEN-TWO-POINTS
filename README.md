# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math module
### Step 2: 
Assign values to variables
### Step 3: 
Calculate the distance by Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the result and Execute the program
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1,y1=4,2
x2,y2=10,6
distance=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")

```


### OUTPUT:
